# TX81Z Patch Name Reader

---

> A simple TX81Z patch name reader. The file format is somewhat specific. It looks for a string of characters (ccc222) after each patch name. I have found some patches that do not have these characters. I may expand this project and learn a little more about the format in the future. For now, my dad was going through and copying these names out of a hex editor, so I just threw this together.
